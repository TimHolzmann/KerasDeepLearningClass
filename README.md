# KerasDeepLearningClass

This is a repository with my labs and projects for the Coursera class, [Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras](https://www.coursera.org/learn/building-deep-learning-models-with-tensorflow) (DL0120EN).  This course has seven modules:

 - **Module 1: Advanced Keras Functionalities** -- This module provides an overview of Keraâ€™s advanced features. It will cover Keras's functional API for complex model creation and the creation of custom layers and models in Keras. Then, the module describes the integration of Keras with TensorFlow 2. x for enhanced functionality.
   
 - **Module 2: Advanced CNNs in Keras** -- In this module, you will learn to develop advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using Keras. You will learn data augmentation techniques with Keras. In addition, you will implement transfer learning with Keras and leverage pre-trained models. Finally, you will learn how to use TensorFlow to enhance image processing capabilities.
   
 - **Module 3: Transformers in Keras** -- This module covers building and training advanced Transformers using Keras. You will further develop Transformer models for sequential data and time series using TensorFlow with Keras. In addition, you will learn to implement advanced Transformer techniques for text generation.
 - **Module 4: Unsupervised Learning and Generative Models in Keras** -- In this module, you will learn the principles of unsupervised learning in Keras. You will learn to build and train autoencoders and diffusion models. In addition, you will develop generative adversarial networks (GANs) using Keras and integrate TensorFlow for advanced unsupervised learning tasks.
 - **Module 5: Advanced Keras Techniques and Course Project** -- In this module, you will learn advanced techniques for model development in Keras. You will create custom training loops, optimize models using Keras, and perform hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner. Finally, you will learn to use TensorFlow for model optimization and custom training loops.
 - **Module 6: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with Keras** -- In this module, you will learn the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and its applications in Keras. The module also covers the Q-Learning algorithms using Keras. You will develop and train deep Q-networks (DQNs) with Keras for advanced reinforcement learning tasks.
 - **Module 7: Final Project and Assessment** -- In this module, you will implement the final project and attempt the final assessment.
